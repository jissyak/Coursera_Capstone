#Introduction to the Business problem 
Predicting the severity of accidents is crucial to understand the causes and reduce such unfortunate incidences.  Due to the increase in population as well as motorization, the number of accidents has been increasing globally.  Hence, accidents are a leading cause of death across the world and also a huge economical burden. Though measures are regularly enfoRced to reduce accidents and increase awareness regarding the importance of ensuring safety, they continue to occur frequently. In addition to the suffering caused by the loss of human life and disabilities, the macroeconomic burden is high. The increased expenditure, such as health care, specialized force training, unemployment due to disabilities, all add to the burden. In 2020, WHO reported that Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Hence, it is vital to find ways to minimize accidents and in turn to human life and society.
