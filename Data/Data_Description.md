# DATA

The data used for this study has been collected and shared by the Seattle Police Department (recorded by Traffic Records). This data is provided by Coursera for downloading through a link (provided below).

The dataset reports all collisions which occurred in the period from 2004 to the date issued (updated weekly).  The dataset provides information regarding the severity of the traffic accident, location, type of collision, weather, road and light conditions, visibility, number of people involved, etc.

The data set provided for this work allows the analysis of a record of 200,000 accidents in the state of Seattle. This set is sufficiently large for an accurate prediction of the accident severity.  It includes 37 different attributes related to recorded accidents. Several attributes such as ‘UNDERINF’, SPEEDING’, ‘ROADCOND’, (i.e. whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision (Y/N), the condition of the road during the collision. ) can be analyzed for understanding how gravely they contribute to the accidents.  Further, the data is also coded in accordance with the State Collision Code Dictionary, describing various factors such as the direction of vehicles involved, type of vehicle, etc. 

The data will be cleaned and used so that we can determine which attributes are most common in traffic accidents in order to target prevention at these high-incidence points.

This analysis should help anyone interested, to focus their resources on handling the most contributing factors and determine 
a prevention strategy.
