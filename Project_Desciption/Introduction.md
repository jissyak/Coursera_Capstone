# Introduction to the Business problem 

Due to the increase in population as well as motorization, the number of accidents has been increasing globally. 
Hence, accidents are a leading cause of death across the world and also a huge economical burden. Predicting the severity of accidents is crucial to understand the causes, the correlation between different factors, and reduce such unfortunate incidences.  
Though measures are regularly enforced to reduce accidents and increase awareness regarding the importance of ensuring safety, they continue to occur frequently. 
In addition to the suffering caused by the loss of human life and disabilities, the macroeconomic burden is high. 
The increased expenditure, such as health care, specialized force training, unemployment due to disabilities, all add to the burden. 
In 2020, WHO reported that road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. 
Hence, it is vital to find ways to minimize accidents and in turn the adverse effects on human life and society. 

## Problem definition:

* What are the effects of different factors, among those reported? How do different factors effect the accident severity?
* What patterns/correlations can we determine between these factors?
