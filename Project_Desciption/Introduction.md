# Introduction to the Business problem 

## Background
Due to the increase in population as well as motorization, the number of accidents has been increasing globally. 
Accidents are a leading cause of death across the world. Better predictions of the severity of accidents are crucial to enhance the safety performance of road traffic systems, and reduce such unfortunate incidences.  
Though measures are in place to reduce accidents and increase awareness regarding the importance of ensuring safety, accidents continue to occur frequently. 
In addition to the suffering caused by the loss of human life and resulting disabilities, the economic burden is quite high. 
The increased expenditure, such as health care, specialized force training, unemployment due to disabilities, all add to this burden. 
In 2020, WHO reported that road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. 
Hence, it is vital to find ways to minimize accidents and in turn the adverse effects on human life and society. 
A literature survey shows that driver injury severity can be classified into a few categories such as property damage, possible/evident injury, or disabling injury/fatality.  Hence, modeling accident severity can be addressed as a pattern recognition problem.  Such a problem can be solved by deep learning, statistical techniques, or by physical modeling approaches. In a deep learning model, an input vector (attribute) is often mapped into an output vector (target label) through a set of nonlinear functions. In the case of accident severity, the attributes are the characteristics of the accident, such as driver behavior, road and weather conditions, etc. The target label in this case would be the accident severity. 

## Problem definition:

* To predict the severity of accidents to enhance the safety performance of road traffic systems.

## Target Audience

  Government, WHO, any company/enterprise involved in marketing road safety equipment. As the aim is to predict the severity of accidents, anyone or any company/organization is a target audience as the success of enhancing safety depends on collaborative work.
